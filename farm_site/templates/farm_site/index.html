      <p>
        Local Roots is a family-run vegetable farm in the Snoqualmie river valley, about 20 miles outside of Seattle. Wife and husband team Siri and Jason, along with a small crew of workers and apprentices, grow about ten acres of vegetables, which we sell at Seattle-area farmers markets, through our Community Supported Agriculture subscription program, and to many fine restaurants.
